# Million Game (Chemistry Edition)

This project is a React application for "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Chemistry Edition).
It was refactored to use Vite and organized into a standard React project structure.

## Structure
- `src/components`: UI components and game-specific components.
- `src/pages`: Main game pages.
- `src/entities`: Schema definitions.
- `src/api`: Mock API client.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## notes
The backend API (`base44`) is currently mocked in `src/api/base44Client.js`.
